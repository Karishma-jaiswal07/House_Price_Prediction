# House Price Prediction App
## Overview
This is a machine learning project that predicts house prices based on their area using a Simple Linear Regression model. The app provides a user-friendly interface to input the area of a house and get a predicted price.
## Features
Predicts house prices based on area (square feet/meters).
Uses a pre-trained simple linear regression model for accurate predictions.
Provides a clean and interactive interface for user inputs.
Visualizes the relationship between area and price.
## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization 
## Model Details
Algorithm: Simple Linear Regression
Equation: Price = m * Area + c
m: Slope (learned by the model).
c: Intercept (learned by the model).
Evaluation: Include any evaluation metric scores (e.g., Mean Squared Error, RÂ² score).
